Data-Project-Election-Analysis

Election Data Project
In this Data Project we will be looking at data from the 2012 election.

In this project we will analyze two datasets. The first data set will be the results of political polls. We will analyze this aggregated poll data and answer some questions:

1.) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
2.) Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?
3.) How do undecided voters effect the poll?
4.) Can we account for the undecided voters?
5.) How did voter sentiment change over time?
6.) Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
